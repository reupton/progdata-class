```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# ^^^ this code makes it so when you knit it runs all the code and then knits the rest into a document with the code output

# insert code chunk with command + shift + i

- you can't put regular text in a code chunk
  - you can put regular text outside of a code chunk
  - below is the answer to a question from my second homework assignment in regression with Dr. Wiernik

```{r penguin, echo=FALSE}

dat_penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins

histo_penguins <- ggplot(data = dat_penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_histogram()

histo_penguins

```

# Default For Chunk Output
- Don't like the code output appearing inline in your rmd file?
  - Click the gear icon and change where chunk output results appear to "in console" or leave as "inline
