```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load packages}

library(tibble)

```


```{r cars}

mtcars_tbl <- as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "model") #rownames keeps rownames and has you label that column

mtcars

mtcars_tbl

knitr::kable(mtcars_tbl) ## do this to use a function from a package instead of loading the whole package, if only using a few functions

# knitr::kable() formats a table nicely when you knit it :)

```


# what is a tibble, what does the function do?
- a tibble is a type of data frams
  - gives info about what kind of variable it is (numeric)
  - when you print a tibble it doesn't print all data, just gives overview
  - tibble default is to delete row names
