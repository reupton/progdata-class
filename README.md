# Programming With Data Repo

My work for the class programming with data will go in this repo

## Who am I and why am I taking this class? 

**Hello!** My name is Becky and I am a first year Social Psychology PhD student at USF. I am from Santa Cruz, CA (*Below* is a picture of Santa Cruz)

I am taking this class because I am *trying* to get better at using **R** so that I can use it to run analyses for my first year project.

## My research interests
- Gender scripts and how they influence
   - behaviors within and beliefs about romantic relationships
   - prejudice towards gender and sexual minorities

## Excited to learn more about R with everyone!
   

*Me when I realize my code wasn't running because I spelled something wrong*
