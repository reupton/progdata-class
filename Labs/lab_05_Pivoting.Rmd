```{r set up}
library(tidyverse)
lotr  <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/lotr_tidy.csv") |> 
  rename(Species = Race)
```

## 1. Would you say this data is in tidy format?

```{r look at data}
head(lotr)
```
Yes, this data is in tidy format.

## 2. Widen the data so that we see the words spoken by each species, by putting species as its own column.

```{r widen words}
lotr_wide <- lotr |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(-Species, -Words), 
              names_from  = Species, 
              values_from = Words)
```
## 3. Re-lengthen the wide LOTR data from Question 2 above.

```{r}
lotr_wide |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Elf, Hobbit, Man), 
               names_to  = "Species", 
               values_to = "Words")
```
