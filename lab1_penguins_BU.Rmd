## Instructions

Use some R functions to explore this data frame a bit. For example, what is the general structure of the dataset? How many rows does it have? How many colums? What are the descriptive statistics for some of the important variables?

You should: 1. Demonstrate the use of at least three functions. 2. Write code comments with # describing what the functions you are using do.

```{r load data}

dat_penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins ## assigning data frame

head(dat_penguins)

```
```{r means}

mean(dat_penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE) ## gives mean flipper length

mean(dat_penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)

range(dat_penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

```


```{r plot flippers}

plot(dat_penguins$flipper_length_mm)

```
